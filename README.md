# System-Monitor

Build a process manager for the Linux Operating system that resembles the program htop which is a standard program for monitoring Linux systems.
Linux stores data about the processes running on the system in lots of different files. 
So I read from these files, structure the data, process it and then format it for ouput to the terminal.

It is based on object oriented programming.
